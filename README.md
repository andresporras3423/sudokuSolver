This UiPath-based project is designed to solve Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulty levels. The majority of the content in the sudoku folder is adapted from this [Sudoku](https://github.com/kunal1/sudoku) repo.

The original code has been modified to use the [dosuku API generator](https://sudoku-api.vercel.app), as the original implementation did not always produce puzzles with unique solutions.
